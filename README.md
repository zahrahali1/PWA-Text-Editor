# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description 

In this project I built a text editor that runs in the browser that aims to develop a text editor web application that allows users to create and manage notes both online and offline.

JATE is a web-based text editor application that utilizes JavaScript and IndexedDB for offline functionality and persistent storage of text content directly within the browser.

## Installation

To run this program all you need to do through terminal is
npm i to install the packages 
and npm run start:dev 

When I open the text editor, I can add content to the database:
![Adding Text](images/Addingtext.png)

Then I can find the content in the text editor and click install:
![Click Install](images/install.png)

This would save it to the database. Then I can find the content in the text editor:
![Content Saved](images/saves.png)
